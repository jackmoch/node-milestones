# Global object

## Introduction

### `global`

### V8 JavaScript engine

## Topics Covered

-   Command-line applications
-   global object
-   V8 JavaScript engine

## Requirements

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `03.js`. The file
should contain JavaScript code to output detailed version information of Node.js
and the underlying V8 JavaScript engine to the terminal through the stdout
stream. In addition, the program should be able to directly execute.

Expected:

```bash
$ ./03.js
Node.js version: v6.3.1
V8 version: 5.0.71.57
```

## Bonus

-   Use an ES6 Template Literal and its string interpolation feature
-   Use a single call to `console.log`
-   Use ES6 Destructuring Assignment to extract the two variables from the
    `versions` object
